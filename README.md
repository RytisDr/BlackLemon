# Black Lemon Vitamin Shop

## Things to note:

- CSS is written in order of appearance of elements, mobile-first approach.
- The product properties at the bottom can be scrolled horizontally.
- Added 3rd, intermediate breakpoint (tablet-ish) to resize more smoothly.
- Everything is custom-written, whole CSS is only around 200 lines.

## Suggestions

- Should be able use Sass, compile to CSS for better development experience.
- Figma design specs aren't necessarily the best as they put out mostly px (pixel size varies from screen to screen).
